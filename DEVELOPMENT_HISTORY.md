# Development History: OGG Audio Format Support

## Project Overview

This repository is a fork of [runpod-workers/worker-faster_whisper](https://github.com/runpod-workers/worker-faster_whisper) that adds support for `.ogg` audio format processing. The fork was created to enable direct processing of `.ogg` files in a RunPod serverless transcription workflow, eliminating the need for audio format conversion and reducing payload sizes.

## Background & Problem Statement

### The Audio Transcription Pipeline

The complete system consists of:
1. **Middleware Server** (Flask application) - Receives audio files and manages transcription jobs
2. **RunPod Worker** (this repository) - Processes audio files using Whisper models
3. **Obsidian Plugin** - Client interface for submitting transcription requests

### Initial Problem: Audio Format Incompatibility

The original issue arose from an audio format mismatch:

- **Middleware**: Sending `.ogg` files (compressed, ~950KB)
- **Official Worker**: Only accepting `.wav` files
- **Result**: `binascii.Error: Incorrect padding` when processing Base64-encoded `.ogg` files

### Failed Solution: OGG-to-WAV Conversion

**Attempt**: Convert `.ogg` to `.wav` in the middleware before sending to worker
**Problem**: 
- Conversion increased file size from ~950KB to ~167MB
- Resulted in `520 Server Error` from Cloudflare due to payload size limits
- Added unnecessary processing overhead

### Root Cause Analysis

Investigation revealed that:
- The underlying `faster-whisper` library supports `.ogg` natively via `ffmpeg`
- The `.wav` requirement was an arbitrary restriction in the worker's handler
- A simple one-line change could enable `.ogg` support without any downsides

## Solution Implementation

### Phase 1: Initial Fork (January 2025)

**Commit**: `4058fcb` - "feat: changed from .wav to .ogg audio format"

```python
# In src/rp_handler.py, line 32
# BEFORE:
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix=".wav", delete=False) as temp_file:

# AFTER:  
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix=".ogg", delete=False) as temp_file:
```

**Result**: Successfully enabled `.ogg` processing but encountered new issues.

### Phase 2: Debugging Attempts (January 2025)

When testing revealed `400 Bad Request` errors during result submission, several debugging commits were made:

- `522d508` - Added debugging for ogg format
- `6391f68` - Enhanced error logging for missing fields  
- `462428a` - Attempted to wrap results in `{"output": whisper_results}`
- `84a545d` - Reverted to returning results directly

**Critical Error**: During debugging, the original `MODEL.predict()` logic was accidentally replaced with custom `WhisperModel` transcription code, which created incompatible output format for RunPod's API.

### Phase 3: Clean Reset & Proper Fix (August 2025)

**Problem Identification**: The custom transcription code was generating different JSON structure than expected by RunPod's serverless API.

**Solution**: 
1. Reset fork to latest upstream (`bd500dc`)
2. Apply only the minimal `.ogg` suffix change
3. Preserve all official worker logic and output formatting

**Final Commit**: `1c54e2a` - "feat: add .ogg audio format support"

## Key Benefits of Current Implementation

### 1. Minimal Change Approach
- Only one line changed from upstream
- Easy to maintain and merge future updates
- Preserves all official functionality

### 2. Performance Improvements from Upstream
By resetting to latest upstream, the fork gained:
- **Lazy Model Loading**: Models loaded on-demand vs. all at startup
- **New Model Support**: "turbo" and "distil-large-v2/v3" models
- **Better Memory Management**: Automatic model unloading and garbage collection
- **Enhanced Format Support**: Improved VTT and SRT formatting

### 3. Problem Resolution
- ✅ **400 Bad Request Fixed**: Proper output format compatible with RunPod API
- ✅ **Payload Size Optimized**: Direct `.ogg` processing (950KB vs 167MB)  
- ✅ **Processing Efficiency**: No conversion overhead
- ✅ **Future-Proof**: Based on latest official worker code

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Changes
- **Single File Modified**: `src/rp_handler.py`
- **Single Line Changed**: Line 32, tempfile suffix
- **No Logic Changes**: All transcription logic remains official/upstream

### Audio Processing Flow
1. Middleware sends Base64-encoded `.ogg` file
2. Worker creates temporary `.ogg` file (instead of `.wav`)
3. `faster-whisper` processes `.ogg` natively via `ffmpeg`
4. Results returned in official RunPod-compatible format

### Compatibility
- **RunPod API**: Fully compatible output format
- **Whisper Models**: All official models supported including "turbo"
- **Audio Formats**: `.ogg` files processed natively, `.wav` still supported via URL input

## Deployment & Testing

### Docker Build
The fork uses the same build process as the official worker:
```bash
docker build -t your-registry/worker-faster-whisper:latest .
docker push your-registry/worker-faster-whisper:latest
```

### RunPod Configuration
Update your RunPod endpoint to use the custom image:
- Image: `your-registry/worker-faster-whisper:latest`
- All other settings remain the same as official worker

### Testing Payload
```json
{
  "input": {
    "audio_base64": "<base64-encoded-ogg-file>",
    "model": "turbo",
    "transcription": "plain_text"
  }
}
```

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Staying Current with Upstream
To incorporate future upstream updates:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
# Resolve any conflicts in the single line change
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

### Monitoring for Breaking Changes
Watch for changes in:
- `src/rp_handler.py` - May affect the suffix line
- `src/predict.py` - Model loading or output format changes
- `requirements.txt` - Dependency updates

### Testing Checklist
When updating or testing:
- [ ] `.ogg` files process successfully
- [ ] Output format matches RunPod API expectations
- [ ] No `400 Bad Request` errors in worker logs
- [ ] Transcription quality maintained
- [ ] New upstream features work (new models, etc.)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 400 Bad Request Errors
- **Cause**: Usually incompatible output format
- **Check**: Ensure using official `MODEL.predict()` method
- **Solution**: Verify no custom transcription logic added

### Payload Too Large Errors  
- **Cause**: Attempting to convert large files to `.wav`
- **Check**: Confirm middleware sending `.ogg` directly
- **Solution**: Ensure no audio conversion in middleware

### Model Loading Issues
- **Cause**: Upstream model changes or new model names
- **Check**: Review `src/predict.py` for `AVAILABLE_MODELS`
- **Solution**: Update middleware to use supported model names

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Multi-Format Support**: Could extend to support additional formats (`.mp3`, `.m4a`)
2. **Dynamic Format Detection**: Auto-detect format from Base64 content
3. **Format Validation**: Add input validation for supported formats

### Monitoring Points
- RunPod API changes that might affect output format requirements
- Faster-Whisper library updates that might change audio format support
- Upstream worker changes that might conflict with the suffix modification

## Contact & Maintenance

This fork is maintained as part of the Whisper GPU Middleware project. For questions or issues:

1. Check worker logs in RunPod dashboard
2. Verify middleware is sending correct payload format
3. Ensure latest fork version is deployed
4. Review this document for common solutions

The goal is to maintain minimal divergence from upstream while providing essential `.ogg` format support for the middleware integration.
